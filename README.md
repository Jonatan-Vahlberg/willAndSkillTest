    A problem arose early on as beta.stockzoom.se/adminium/ returned a parked website not sure if this is intended or not. This also meant that for now i see no diffrence in getting the full list and the detail of a list item as the same data is contained in either one.
    
    A mysterious error came during initalization which required me to manually update a value in node_modules\metro-config\src\defaults\blacklist.js in acordance with this thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120990/how-to-resolve-the-error-on-react-native-start awnser by (clem) any time i ran npm install and intalled all packages as such for anyone testing might have to do the same after running npm install/ yarn install

    Due to never having worked with portfolios before it takes a while for me to realise what all the data is and where it could be useful

    During the morning the server was unresponsive and without it it was impossible to work on the task at hand. added temporary mock data from the data i remebered to work with while server was presumed down.

    After the error was fixed i started getting 502 status errors so it once again halted progress. After it started working again i made a cached version of the data if the connection ever broke again.

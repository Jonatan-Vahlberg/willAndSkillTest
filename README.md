    A problem arose early on as beta.stockzoom.se/adminium/ returned a parked website not sure if this is intended or not. This also meant that for now i see no diffrence in getting the full list and the detail of a list item as the same data is contained in either one.
    
    A mysterious error came during initalization which required me to manually update a value in node_modules\metro-config\src\defaults\blacklist.js in acordance with this thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120990/how-to-resolve-the-error-on-react-native-start awnser by (clem) any time i ran npm install and intalled all packages as such for anyone testing might have to do the same after running npm install/ yarn install
